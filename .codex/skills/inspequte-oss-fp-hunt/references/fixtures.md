# Fixture Notes

## Kotlin fixture
- Repository: `plasmoapp/plasmo-config`
- Why: small Kotlin JVM library that emits Kotlin-generated bytecode patterns.

## Java+Guava fixture
- Repository: `launchdarkly/okhttp-eventsource`
- Why: Java-focused library with Guava in classpath, suitable for checking nullness-related handling around external APIs.

## Local patch policy
- Patches are applied only in `target/oss-fp/workdir/*`.
- The skill injects local plugin resolution with `includeBuild(<inspequte-repo>/gradle-plugin)`.
